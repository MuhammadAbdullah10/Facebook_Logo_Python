# Facebook_Logo_Python

The Python code to make the **Facebook** logo using the **turtle** library is a script that uses the turtle graphics module to draw the iconic logo of the popular social media platform. The turtle library provides a simple way to create graphics and is often used in introductory programming courses.

The code begins by importing the **turtle** library and creating a new turtle object. It then sets the background color to white and the pen size to **7**. The turtle is then positioned to start drawing the circular shape of the **Facebook** logo using the **circle()** method.

Once the circle is complete, the turtle is repositioned to draw the white triangle and curved lines that make up the lower portion of the logo. The **begin_fill()** method is used to fill the triangle and curved shapes with white color.

Finally, the turtle is hidden using the **hideturtle()** method and the **done()** method is called to complete the drawing and close the turtle window.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of turtle graphics to create a simple yet recognizable logo, and can be used as a starting point for exploring more complex graphics and visualization projects using Python.
